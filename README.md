# CS302Final

This project implements a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) simulation using the Taichi programming language. 

## Features
Taichi-based Differentiable MPM: Implements MPM with automatic differentiation for optimization.
Actuation and Control: Supports sinusoidal and feedback-based actuation for shape and locomotion design.
Particle-to-Grid and Grid-to-Particle Transfers: Implements standard P2G and G2P mappings.
Grid-Based Operations: Applies forces like gravity and handles boundary conditions.
Optimization-Friendly: Enables backpropagation through physics simulations for learning-based control.
